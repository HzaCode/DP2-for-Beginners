# Tricks (Continuously Updated)

- **Save MainPage Last**: Ensure to save the main page last to avoid incorporating data from other websites.
- **Reparse Instead of Download**: Opt for reparsing instead of downloading; refresh data and wait for **`HasNew1`** to indicate new content.
- **Post-Modification Steps**: After modifications, conduct a batch reparse, execute **`HasNew1`**, and then push the study.
- **Data Structure Integrity**:
  - By default, include the **`dp2_id`** field in the **`detail`** structure to avoid reference errors in **`data_out`**.
- **Data Processing Workflow Update**:
  - Simply changing **`study`** is not sufficient for updating data; it requires **`HasNew1`**, followed by a **`push study`**.
- **Using `dp2_id`**:
  - The **`dp2_id`** is a unique identifier for each detail page, distinct from **`category_id`** which might repeat across multiple pages.
  - In MongoDB, use **`dp2_id`** as the unique identifier for data entry.
- **Managing Multi-Step Task Parameters**:
  - In tasks with multiple steps, pass necessary parameters through **`extra_data`**.
- **Understanding Fields in `TASK`**:
  - Extract various fields like **`TASK_url`** and **`TASK_extra_data`** from **`TASK`**.
  - Use **`TASK_extra_data`** for extracting information such as **`category_id`**.
- **Project Names and Task Correlation**:
  - One **`project_name`** may include many **`tasks`**, each with its unique **`id`**.
- **Using `TASK_extra_data` in Jextor**:
  - In Jextor, use **`TASK_extra_data`** to extract specific details like **`category_id`**.
